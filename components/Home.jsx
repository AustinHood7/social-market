                        With the expansion of digital media over the past decade millions of people see opportunites every day; whether stumbling across an exciting new start-up
                        , an up and coming musician, new actors in their premier film, or a first-year athlete. Accredited investors are the ony people able to tap into this market.
                        Allowing the general public access through a public market of TV shows, a new artist album, or a revolutionary new start-up through a public market would allow 
                        seemingly endless opportunities across the globe.
